                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>IHarnessing the power of deep learning, I developed a cutting-edge predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, achieving an impressive 96% accuracy in forecasting stock prices with data from Yahoo Finance. This innovative project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide highly accurate predictions, demonstrating the potential of AI in revolutionizing financial analysis and investment strategies.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>In this exciting project, I leveraged advanced machine learning techniques to develop a highly accurate banknote authentication system. Utilizing the power of Random Forest Classifiers, I meticulously tuned the model parameters through an extensive GridSearchCV process to identify the optimal settings. With features extracted from real-world data, the final model achieved an exceptional accuracy rate, demonstrating its efficacy in distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit banknotes.</p>
